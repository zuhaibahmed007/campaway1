                    <p>Welcome to campaway.co.nz (the ‘site’), a website operated by Campaway Ltd. (“Campaway”, “we”, “us” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Campaway that apply to the entire content of the site, to any content produced by the site and to any offerings provided through the site (collectively, the “Campaway Platform”), including using the services and resources available or enabled via the site (each a ‘service; and collectively, the ‘services’), whether by Campaway or by users of the site (‘users’). The Campaway platform provides the Site and Services to enable “Hosts” to publish and offer Property and Accommodation (collectively, “Listings”), “Experiences” and/or other services (collectively, “Host Services”) to guests (“Campers”) who may search for, book and/or use those services by making reservations for short-term stays (‘Bookings’) on Listings published by Hosts. Campaway does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services, nor is it a real estate broker or insurer. Any Booking made via our website is directly between the Camper and entity that owns or manages such Listing and/or Host Services; we are not a party to such contracts concluded directly between Hosts and Campers. We have created a privacy policy that describes our collection, use and disclosure practices regarding any personal information that you provide to us (glampaway.co.nz/privacy).</p>
                    <h6>1.0 Camper Terms</h6>
                    <p>As a Camper, you are responsible for performing the obligations of any agreement you may have with a Host. As soon as you receive your booking confirmation, you form a direct contract between you and the Host, which includes the cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout. Campaway is not a party to such agreements, and, with the exception of its payment obligations, Campaway disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements</p>

You agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Campaway or a third party selected by Campaway, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from Campaway. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Campaway should be submitted at https://hipca.mp/support. After the Notice is received, you and Campaway may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Campaway do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding as set forth below. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>
